# Overview

Java is the first language I have ever learned, as a software developer that is currently expanding my technicals skills I decieded to build this Tool Organizer App. This is an inventory management system that helps users to track their tools. This app is created to review Java Fundamentals and GUI by builthing something practical and useful that can solve a real-world problem.
